# Final_project: Snake Game with Hand Tracking

This project features a Python-based Snake game with a unique twist—it’s controlled using hand tracking! It’s an interactive experience with two fun game modes to choose from: Timed Mode and Endless Mode. The game makes use of the **cvzone** and **cv2** libraries to handle hand tracking and create the graphics.
